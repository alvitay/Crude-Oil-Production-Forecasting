# Crude-Oil-Production-Forecasting
----------------
## **Context**
----------------

The world economy relies heavily on hydrocarbons, particularly oil, for the provision of energy required in transportation and other industries. Crude oil production is considered one of the most important indicators of the global economy. Dependence on oil and its finite nature, pose some complex problems including estimation of future production patterns.

Crude oil production forecasting is an important input into the decision-making process and investment scenario evaluation, which are crucial for oil-producing countries. Governments and businesses spend a lot of time and resources figuring out the production forecast that can help to identify opportunities and decide on the best way forward.

------------------
## **Objective**
------------------

In this case study, we will analyze and use historical oil production data, from 1992 to 2018, for a country to forecast its future production. We need to build a time series forecasting model using the AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models in order to forecast oil production.

--------------------------
## **Data Dictionary**
--------------------------

The dataset that we will be using is 'Crude Oil Production by Country'. This dataset contains the yearly oil production of 222 countries, but for simplicity, we will use only one country to forecast its future oil production.
